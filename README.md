# q2lmstats
This project is the web front-end for my fork of Q2 LMCTFÂ https://github.com/mgd34msu/lmctf60. I have added extensive new in-game stat tracking to the game, and have also implemented lightweight database support through SQLite. This API hits the SQLite backend to allow players to access stats from outside of the Quake2 client.
